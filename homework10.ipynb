    "In this exercise, you will practice using deep learning with artificial neural networks and the Pytorch library to build classification models. Note that Pytorch is **not** included in the Anaconda distribution by default. You have three options for using Pytorch to complete this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Pytorch locally (for free). You can see the directions on the [Pytorch website here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Select the stable build, your operating system, Conda (for Anaconda), Python, and CPU to see install directions for your particular setup. (CUDA is used to support hardware acceleration with NVIDIA graphics cards and is not necessary for this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a [Duke OIT container](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers). Make sure to use the **PyTorch** one. If you have not already reserved your container, see the class website's [Resources & Getting Help](https://sites.duke.edu/compsci216fa2022/resources-getting-help/) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Pytorch in a Jupyter notebook in the cloud (also for free). The easiest way to do this is with a Google colab notebook; Pytorch will already be available to you in this cloud environment. If you choose this option, go to the [Google colab website](https://colab.research.google.com) select \"Upload\" at the right side of the orange menu bar, and select this `.ipynb` file. You can then complete the assignment in colab and download the completed `.ipynb` file to turn in on Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is tutorial style; in general we will provide the necessary code and simply ask you to run the code, observe what happens, and answer questions based on the code. Some of the questions you will answer as a Sakai Quiz (with unlimited attempts), the rest you will answer in this notebook. The code in this assignment is based on the image classification example presented in the [Deep Learning with Pytorch: A 60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) tutorial and the [Pytorch Basics Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html#). You are welcome and encouraged to visit these and other Pytorch [tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/), [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html), and [recipes/examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes_index.html) as needed or for your own interest and learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you finish please confirm that your notebook and its output looks correct before submitting your .ipynb file (the notebook file) on gradescope. If you select Kernel -> Restart and Run All, please allow time for the code to finish executing; the code in this notebook may take a few minutes to run."

    "### Question 1: The Data\n",
    "First, we import the necessary libraries and download the `CIFAR-10` dataset from Pytorch. The `CIFAR-10` dataset consists of 60,000 32 by 32 pixel color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The classes of the images are things like `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`, etc. You can read more about the dataset at the [curator's website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following code to import necessary libraries, download the data, and preview some of the images along with their classes. **Note that this step may take a few minutes depending on your internet speed**; the dataset is about 160 MB. Once you have downloaded the data once, rerunning the cell should be fast; it will verify that you already have the dataset rather than redownload every time."
